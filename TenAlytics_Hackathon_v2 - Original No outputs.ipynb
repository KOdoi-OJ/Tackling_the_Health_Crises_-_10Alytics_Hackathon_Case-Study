    "    + Given the recent \"japa\" movmement, they may also want to incentivise doctors to stay in the country so as to at least maintain the number of doctors per thousand.\n",

    "2. **Ethiopia (Orange):** Ethiopia has recorded total deaths between 0.5 and 0.9 million over the period, while their healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP is just about average. Like Nigeria, even with increases in healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP, total deaths increase. This is particularly concerning and creates a need to assess other options of reducing the total deaths in the country. For starters, it will be best for the government to invest in their healthcare as they take other steps to reduce the year-on-year total deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **South Africa (Yellow):** Unlike Nigeria and Ethiopia, the total deaths in South Africa seems to respond positively to increases in health expenditure as a percentage of GDP. This should motivate the government to invest more in their health sector to improve healthcare delivery and reduce the total deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Least investors:** Even though they had low total deaths, Zimbabwe, Somalia and Libya seemed to have made barely any investment in their health sector. *Comments are reserved until I am able to get more data on their healthcare expenditure.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Highest investors:** Sierra Leone, Malawi, Sao Tome, and Lesotho seem to have made the most investments in their healthcare over the period. This is reflected in their relatively low total deaths over the period.

    "1. Doctors per thousand and the percentage of GDP invested in healthcare are negatively correlated with deaths per thousand. This means that deaths per thousand decrease as these variables increase. This may be partly understandable, as the returns on investing in healthcare are not reaped immediately. Countries should therefore want to focus on investing more in the training of healthcare professionals to increase doctors per thousand and investing in healthcare infrastructure in order to reduce the number of deaths per thousand and prepare their respective countries for increased healthcare demands from the relatively young African population.\n",
    "2. In the short term, however, governments may consider providing additional training and resources to healthcare professionals in order to improve their ability to provide adequate healthcare to citizens.\n",
    "3. Majority of African countries invest between 4% to 6% of their GDP on health expenditure as compared to the ~ 9% average for the global north. This needs to improve for significant healthcare gains.\n",
    "4. The total deaths vs. healthcare investment percent in Nigeria and Ethiopia is not the best, and may require substantial investment to improve. The improvements in South Africa should be motivation to other countries to invest in their healthcare sector more in order to reduce total deaths. Zimbabwe, Somalia and Libya seemed to have made barely any investment in their health sector, while Sierra Leone, Malawi, Sao Tome, and Lesotho seem to have made the most investments over the period; the results are evident in their comparative total deaths vs. healthcare investment positions.\n",
    "5. The leading causes of death in Africa are Cardiovascular diseases (39m), HIV/AIDS (35m), Neonatal disorders (31m), Diarrheal diseases (29m), and Lower respiratory infections (28.8m), and Malaria (27.8m).  These six are the same for deaths among young adults in Africa, with Diarrheal diseases dropping to 6th. On average, this has been the case from 2010 to 2019 with significant increases almost every two years, and therefore requires African governments to prioritize their prevention, treatment and reduction. \n",
    "    + The position of neonatal disorders is very concerning because it would likely have been much worse if it affected men just as commonly as it does women. This should prompt immediate action and trigger focus on maternal care and education of women with regard to their lifestyles during pregnancy.\n",
    "    + An immediate step may be to collaborate with relevant stakeholders to educate the citizenry and advocate for preventive measures such as healthier lifestyles. \n",
    "    + In the medium term (3-5 years), governments may also develop policies and programs aimed at improving public health and reducing the risk factors associated with these causes of death among Africans.\n",
    "    + In the long term, African governments need to conduct further research into the factors driving the prevalent causes of death and develop strategies for preventing and reducing them.\n",
    "5. The number of deaths per thousand increases as doctors per thousand also increases. With a coefficient of determination of 49%, *the data indicates* that changes in doctors per thousand may explain about 49% of variations in cardiovascular deaths per thousand. This alludes to the earlier finding that doctors per thousand may not necessarily be a good predictor of deaths per thousand. This observation does not hold for the whole continent though, there are significant outliers."

    "Yes and no. Drug abuse should be and should not be Africa's immediate health concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why no?** From the analysis, we noted that cardiovascular diseases, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, diarrheal diseases, and lower respiratory infections have plagued Africans for over 10 years running. For this reason, Africa's priority in the short term should be to combat these diseases. We must also acknowledge that long term drug abuse can lead to cardiovascular diseases (whose leading causes are lifestyle factors); this leads us to the answer of why yes. We also note a relatively low number of doctors per thousand and low healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP, these should the primary focus of African countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why yes?** Long term drug abuse can lead to cardiovascular diseases. Yes, drug abuse can lead to high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, increased risk of stroke, heart attack, and heart failure. It can also lead to inflammation of the heart muscle, which can cause the heart to become enlarged and reduce the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently. These are *tied directly to* cardiovascular diseases. \n",
    "And so by answering yes to if drug abuse should be Africa's immediate health concern, we mean to say that in order to avert a drug abuse-driven health crises in the future, Africa should take immediate steps to curtail the prevalence of drug abuse. This may begin with education and sensitization of the citizenry, passage of relevant policies and strict enforcement of laws on drugs."
