# SUMMARY OF INSIGHTS
## FOCUS OF REPORT
This report examined the correlations between healthcare investment, doctors per thousand, and deaths per thousand in African countries. 

## RECOMMENDATIONS
- The findings suggest that investing in healthcare resources and infrastructure and training more healthcare professionals can be key to reducing the number of deaths per thousand. 
- In the short term, governments should provide additional training and resources to healthcare professionals to improve their capacity to provide adequate healthcare services and improve healthcare service delivery outcomes.
- In the medium to long term, the governments need to develop policies and programs aimed at improving public health and reducing the risk factors associated with the leading causes of death in the continent.
- In any case, more research needs to be conducted in order to better understand the factors driving the prevalent causes of death in the continent and inform decisions on how to develop solutions
- Dedicate percentage of tax revenue to healthcare improvement; maybe a dedicated levy

## FINDINGS (what informed said recommendations)
- The majority of African countries invest between 4% to 6% of their GDP on health expenditure as compared to the ~ 9% average for the global north, which needs to improve.
- The largest causes of death in Africa are Cardiovascular diseases, HIV/AIDS, Neonatal disorders, Diarrheal diseases, Lower respiratory infections, and Malaria, and given the trend over the past ten years, immediate measures are needed to reduce the risk factors associated with them. 
- Additionally, though there are significant outliers, we learnt that changes in doctors per thousand may explain about 49% of variations in cardiovascular deaths per thousand, but it is not always a good predictor of deaths per thousand; and more research needs to be conducted to better understand the factors driving it in Africa.

## CONCLUSION
- while preventive measures and further research should be undertaken to reduce the risk factors associated with the leading causes of death in Africa,
- investing in healthcare resources and infrastructure, and training more healthcare professionals can be key

## LIMITATIONS/ CHALLENGES
- Needed more micro level data, at least by gender, so that we can check for and be sure of "balance" and equity. Data on actual number of health facilities per country would have been helpful as well. Raw values of expenditure on healthcare and/or raw GDP values instead of the percentage; this would have allowed for more contextualization of comparisons
